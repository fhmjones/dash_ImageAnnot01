# Dash-based dashboards

Interactive annotation of images. Goal is for an assignment similar one we did in 2017 for EOSC 16.326 using http://literallycanvas.com/.

First attempt shows the timescale image and allows placing a "line" shape, erase, and generate PNG figure.

No graph data, axes removed, no zoom or other interaction with the plot.
